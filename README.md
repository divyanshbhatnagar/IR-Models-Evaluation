# IR-Models-Evaluation
Implemented the Vector Space Model (VSM), Best Matching (BM25) and Divergence from Randomness (DFR) Information Retrieval model on a given set of twitter data
Used the Mean Average Precision (MAP) score as the evaluation criteria for the IR system
Improved the MAP score by implementing techniques like Field Boosting, using Dismax query parser, using multilingual search queries etc.
